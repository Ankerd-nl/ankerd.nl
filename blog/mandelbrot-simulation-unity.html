        <br />The program that we used for this project was Unity. Unity is a so-called game engine, and that makes our life a lot easier because we don’t have to build a 3d renderer ourselves.
        The first object that we started with was just a standard 2d plane in 3d space. We can apply a material to this plane which contains our code. You can kind of see it like a sort of mandelbrot texture of some sorts.
        <br />There are a lot of different languages to program in, and sadly enough we have to use HLSL for this project. Why you might ask? Well, we thought that it would be easier because we have used OSL before in blender and that worked really well. It is also a simple way to ‘code’ a texture. It’s not difficult to program a mandelbrot set with a power of 2. Problems only begin to arise when we try to change the power to something else.
