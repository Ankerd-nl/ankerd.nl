        This year we decided to host a little competition to see who could make the best (maybe not the best) logo for ankerd. The only rule was the following: the logo with the majority of the votes wins.
        The turnout was bigger than expected with a grand total of 20 submissions. One logo in particular really stood out, which is also the one that won in the competition. He submitted his design a few hours before the submission period had ended.
        Most of the contestants already submitted their designs a week before he did.
        <br />
        Then it was time for voting. Voting was really exciting because it was a tie for the majority of the voting period, but then disaster struck. We found out that one of the contestants had been cheating to get more votes. He used a few alt accounts to vote on himself.
        We had no choice other than to disqualify him and his logo entirely. Pamu won with 8 measly votes, he was closely followed by... no one. All of the other logos only had a few votes sadly.
        <br />Anyways, congratulations on your stellar performance! Your logo is here to stay untill the 31st of December 2022.
